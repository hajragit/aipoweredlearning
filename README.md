This project leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 to automatically generate quizzes, presentation slides, and Q&amp;A pairs from structured or unstructured documents. The system processes input documents, extracts key concepts, and generates relevant educational content, making it ideal for e-learning, corporate training, and content summarization.
